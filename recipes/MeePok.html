    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Mee pok is a vibrant, street-style noodle dish that’s all about bold
      flavors, springy texture, and soul-satisfying comfort. At its core, mee
      pok features flat, yellow egg noodles — firm, slightly chewy, and tossed
      until they gleam with a slick, flavorful sauce.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sauce is the heart of it all: a savory, tangy, and spicy mix of black
      vinegar, soy sauce, garlic oil, chili paste, and sometimes a dash of lard
      for richness. Every strand of noodle is coated with attitude. Topping the
      noodles is a colorful medley: minced pork, fish balls, sliced fish cakes,
      and sometimes pork liver or a soft, marinated egg.

    <p>
      A sprinkling of crispy fried shallots, chopped scallions, and maybe a few
      pickled green chilies add punch and aroma. On the side (or poured over), a
      small bowl of clear pork or ikan bilis (anchovy) broth brings balance,
      light and umami-rich, to sip between bites. Mee pok is messy, spicy,
      slurpy, and unapologetically flavorful — a humble dish with a loud
      personality.
