    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pasta is more than just food — it's an edible canvas of comfort, culture,
      and creativity. At its simplest, pasta is made from **flour and water or
      eggs**, kneaded into a smooth dough and shaped into countless forms —
      long, short, twisted, stuffed, ridged, or curled. Whether it’s silky
      ribbons of **tagliatelle**, tiny nubs of **orzo**, or hollow spirals of
      **fusilli**, each shape has a purpose: to catch sauce, cradle fillings, or
      deliver perfect texture in every bite.

    <p>
      When cooked al dente — tender with a slight bite — pasta becomes the soul
      of a dish. It’s blank but expressive, ready to soak up rich tomato sauces,
      creamy Alfredo, peppery olive oil, or fragrant pesto. It can be rustic or
      elegant, served in a humble kitchen or a fine dining restaurant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pasta can be a hug in a bowl — warm, hearty, and deeply satisfying — or a
      light, refined dish laced with fresh herbs and olive oil. It tells stories
      from regions across Italy and beyond, evolving in kitchens around the
      world. In essence, pasta is simple, but never boring. It’s food that feeds
      both body and spirit — endlessly adaptable, universally loved.
